                    hat!"</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="King Claudius">King Claudius: (amused) "Oh, Hamlet, it's just a hat. I'm sure you'll
                    find it."</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="Queen Gertrude"> Queen Gertrude: (sympathetically) "Don't worry, dear. Maybe it's just
                    misplaced. We'll help you look for it."</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="hamlet">Hamlet: (grinning) "Look! I found it! Oh, wait... that's your crown,
                    Uncle."</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="king Claudius">King Claudius: (laughing) "Oh, Hamlet, you never fail to surprise me.
                    That's indeed the royal crown."</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="Queen Gertrude">Queen Gertrude: (teasingly) "Hamlet, I think you might need some
                    glasses. That crown is a bit too big for a hat."?</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="hamlet">Hamlet: (sheepishly) "Well, it does look quite majestic on me, don't you
                    think?"</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="King Claudius"> King Claudius: (playfully) "Yes, my dear prince, but I believe we
                    should keep the crown where it belongs, on my head."</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="Queen Gertrude">Queen Gertrude: (smiling) "Come now, Hamlet, let's continue searching
                    for your missing hat. It must be here somewhere."</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="hamlet">Hamlet: (excitedly) "I found it! Here it is! My beloved hat!"</span> </p>
            <p> <span data-actor="King Claudius">King Claudius: (relieved) "Ah, there you go, Hamlet. See? It was right
                    under your nose."</span> </p>

                    precise."</span> </p>

                    a crown on my head and a hat on my mind!"</span> </p>
